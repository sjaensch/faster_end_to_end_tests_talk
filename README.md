This is the source code to my EuroPython 2017 talk slides "Faster End to End tests with fixture factories". It's a clone of the reveal.js repository with my content added. The text is in the `index.html` file, you can find all the images in the `images` subfolder.

## Presenting

Showing the slides is very easy:

````
npm install
npm start
````

This will install all of the prerequisites (assuming you have `npm` installed) and launch a web browser pointed to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Please refer to the reveal.js documentation](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md) for more information (such as how to generate a PDF version of the slides).
